# ArtCrimeFHE

**ArtCrimeFHE** is a privacy-preserving intelligence analysis platform designed to enable law enforcement agencies and cultural organizations from multiple countries to **collaboratively investigate organized art crime networks**. Leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, sensitive intelligence data remains encrypted throughout the analysis process, ensuring **confidentiality and compliance** while supporting secure cross-border collaboration.

---

## Project Overview

Organized art crime—including theft, forgery, and illicit trafficking—presents a complex global challenge.  
Effective investigation often requires collaboration between multiple jurisdictions and institutions.  
However, sharing sensitive intelligence is restricted by **legal, operational, and privacy considerations**.

**ArtCrimeFHE** addresses this by enabling joint analysis of encrypted datasets without exposing the underlying information.  
Investigators can identify **crime patterns, suspect networks, and trafficking routes** while **protecting the confidentiality of intelligence data**.

---

## Motivation

Key challenges addressed by ArtCrimeFHE:

- **Cross-border data sharing restrictions:** Sensitive intelligence cannot be freely exchanged.  
- **Trust between agencies:** Participating organizations cannot fully trust external parties with raw data.  
- **Data sensitivity:** Revealing ongoing investigations could compromise operations.  
- **Network analysis needs:** Detecting complex criminal networks requires multi-source aggregation.

By leveraging FHE, ArtCrimeFHE ensures that **all computation—including network analysis, risk scoring, and pattern detection—occurs on encrypted data**.  
This allows secure **multi-agency collaboration without sacrificing data privacy**.

---

## Core Objectives

- Enable **multi-party encrypted intelligence analysis** across international agencies.  
- Detect **organized art crime networks** without revealing raw datasets.  
- Protect **sources, methods, and ongoing investigations** from exposure.  
- Support **secure data-driven decision-making** for law enforcement and cultural protection.  
- Facilitate **privacy-compliant operations** while enhancing analytical power.

## Why Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

Traditional intelligence sharing methods either require full data exposure or rely on limited anonymization, risking operational security.  
**FHE provides:**

- Computation directly on encrypted intelligence without decryption.  
- Secure aggregation of multi-agency datasets.  
- Prevention of sensitive data leakage during analysis.  
- Compliance with national and international privacy regulations.

**Problems Solved:**

| Challenge | FHE Solution |
|-----------|--------------|
| Sensitive intelligence exposure | Data remains encrypted throughout analysis |
| Multi-agency trust barriers | No raw data transfer required between agencies |
| Operational security risk | Pattern detection and network analysis done on encrypted data |
| Compliance and auditability | Encryption ensures legal and regulatory adherence |

---

## Example Workflow

1. Agencies encrypt local intelligence data using FHE.  
2. Encrypted datasets are uploaded to the collaboration platform.  
3. FHE engine performs network analysis and computes risk metrics.  
4. Aggregated encrypted results are sent to authorized analysts.  
5. Analysts decrypt summaries and actionable insights locally.  
6. Iterative updates allow dynamic and continuous monitoring of organized crime networks.
